		<title>GetOnMyWifi:  Generate a QR code to help others join your Wifi from an iOS device</title>
	</head>
	<body>

	<h3>GetOnMyWifi produces a QR code which can be printed.   When the QR code is scanned by an iOS device, the device is redirected to a URL which generates a mobile provisioning profile to instruct the iOS device to automatically connect to the wifi network.   When geofencing is enabled, only devices which their report their location within 1/2 mile of the device that created the QR code will be sent the profile.
		
	<br><Br>
	The URL that is encoded in the QR code is unique to your network.  When the QR code is generated, you will be emailed a link allowing you to delete the record from our database if you choose.
	<br><br>
	I will never knowingly share any information from this database.
